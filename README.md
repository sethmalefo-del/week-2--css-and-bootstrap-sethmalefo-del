## Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio for Setlhomara Malefo.
It builds on Week 1 by adding custom CSS and Bootstrap 5 to create a responsive, styled layout.

## Design Layout Choices

1. Structure
- Semantic HTML tags are used for accessibility and clear structure: `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, and `footer`.
- Content is organized into About, Skills, and Contact sections.

2. Navigation
- A responsive Bootstrap navbar (`navbar`, `navbar-expand-lg`) is used for section navigation.
- Navigation links use anchor targets (`#about`, `#skills`, `#contact`).

3. Responsive Layout
- Bootstrap `container`, `row`, and `col-*` classes are used for responsive alignment.
- The design adapts across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.

4. Styling
- Bootstrap is loaded via CDN.
- Custom styles are loaded from `assets/css/style.css`.
- Styling includes spacing, typography, cards, and form presentation.

5. Contact Form
- A contact form is included with Bootstrap form classes:
- `form-label`, `form-control`, `form-select`, and `btn btn-primary`.
